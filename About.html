                <p class="profile-body">As Mayor of the great City of New Orleans, I invite you to visit our city to
                    experience the excitement of Mardi Gras! Mayor of New Orleans The Carnival season officially begins
                    each
                    year on Jan. 6 -- the Feast of the Epiphany, also called Twelfth Night or Kings’ Day. Traditional
                    balls
                    are held in the weeks leading up to the big event. Spectacular parades with colorful, creative
                    floats
                    start rolling before Mardi Gras Day. Our private Carnival clubs, called krewes, take on royalty
                    status
                    and throw beads, doubloons and toys to parade goers. Visitors quickly learn to say, "Throw me
                    something
                    mister!" The culmination of Mardi Gras in New Orleans begins early on Mardi Gras Day when the Zulu
                    Social Aid & Pleasure Club and the Rex Organization parade through the city. Music, food and
                    elaborate
                    costumes add to the fun-filled day of excitement for revelers of all ages. New Orleans, with its
                    unmatched culture and world-famous music and cuisine, is an exciting place to be at any time of the
                    year. We invite everyone to experience Mardi Gras at least once in their lifetime. Make your plans
                    now
                    to be a part of this great tradition and see firsthand why we say, "Laissez les bon temps rouler!"

    <!-- Paragraph -->
    <div class="container">
        <h2 class="MardiGras">Mardi Gras in New Orleans</h2>
        <p class="para">The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the city of New
            Orleans.
            Celebrations are
            concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday (the
            start
            of
            lent in the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one major parade each day (weather
            permitting);
            many
            days have several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the last five days of
            the
            Mardi Gras season. In the final week, many events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding
            communities,
            including parades and balls (some of them masquerade balls).

            The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same parade
            schedule
            and route each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the earliest, Rex,
            the
            Knights of Momus and the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super krewes" are well known for holding
            large
            parades and events, such as the Krewe of Endymion (which is best known for naming celebrities as grand
            marshals
            for their parades), the Krewe of Bacchus (similarly known for naming celebrities as their Kings), as
            well as
            the
            Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club—a predominantly African American krewe. Float riders traditionally toss
            throws
            into the crowds. The most common throws are strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated
            plastic
            "throw cups", Moon Pies, and small inexpensive toys. Major krewes follow the same parade schedule and
            route
            each
            year.

            While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street, major parades originate
            in
            the
            Uptown and Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the
            upriver
            side
            of the French Quarter. Walking parades - most notably the Krewe du Vieux and Chewbacchus - also take
            place
            downtown in the Faubourg Marigny and French Quarter in the weekends preceding Mardi Gras day. Mardi Gras
            day
            traditionally concludes with the "Meeting of the Courts" between Rex and Comus.</p>
